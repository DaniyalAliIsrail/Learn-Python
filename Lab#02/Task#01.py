# Write a program that converts a positive integer into the Roman number system. The Roman number
# system has digits I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C(100), D(500) and M(1000). Numbers up to 3999 are  formed according to the following rules:
# a) As in the decimal system, the thousands, hundreds, tens and ones are expressed separately.
# b) The numbers 1 to 9 are expressed as: 1 I 6 VI 2 II 7 VII 3 III 8 VIII4 IV 9 IX 5 V (An I preceding a V or X is subtracted from the value, and there cannot be more than threeIâ€™s in a row.)
# c) Tens and hundreds are done the same way, except that the letters X, L, C, and C, D, Mare used
# instead of I, V, X respectively.
# Example: Your program should take an input, such as 1978, and convert it to Roman numerals, MCMLXXVIII
