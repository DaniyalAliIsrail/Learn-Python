# Python For Loops
# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string
fruits = ["apple","bannana","cherry"];
for x in fruits: 
 print(x)
 
for x in "banana":
  print(x)
  
# The range() Function
# To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function:
for x in range(11):
  print(x)
